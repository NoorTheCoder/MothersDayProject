    <p>Dear Mommy,</p>
    <p>Happy Motherâ€™s Day! I really appreciate you putting me in classes like piano and CCA and caring for my learning. I am very grateful that you encourage my hobbies and interests like crocheting, drawing, and making crafts. Thank you for all that you do for me.</p>
    <p>Love, Noor</p>
